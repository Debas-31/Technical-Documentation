            <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI),</strong> the ability of a
            digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks
            commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently
            applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the
            intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability
            to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past
            experience.

            Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has
            been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very
            complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical
            theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite
            continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory
            capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human
            flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday
            knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the
            performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing
            certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this
            limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical
            diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting
            recognition.

            All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence,
            while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as
            an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the
            behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female
            wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the
            threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if
            the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the
            wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few
            inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on
            emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food
            is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of
            Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

            Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by
            just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities.
            Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of
            intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and
            using language.

            There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to
            artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and
            error. For example, a simple computer program for solving
            mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is
            found. The program might then store the solution with the position
            so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it
            would recall the solution.
          </p>
          <p class="just">
            This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures known as
            rote learning is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More
            challenging is the problem of implementing what is called
            generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to
            analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the
            past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to
            produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously
            had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to
            generalize can learn the “added” rule and so form the past tense of
            jump based on experience with similar verbs.

            To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation.
            Inferences are classified as either:
            <ul> 
              <li class="list">Deductive or</li>
              <li class="list">Inductive</li>
          </ul>
            . An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or
            the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and
            of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by
            instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument
            failure.”
          </p>
          <p class="just">
            The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is
            that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the
            truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of
            the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute
            assurance. Inductive reasoning is common in science, where data are
            collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict
            future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the
            model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematics
            and logic, where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are
            built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules.

          <p class="just">
            Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be
            characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible
            actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution.
            Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general
            purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular
            problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation
            in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose
            method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One
            general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a
            step-by-step, or incremental, reduction of the difference between
            the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions
            from a list of means—in the case of a simple robot this might
            consist of:
           <ul>
            <li class="list">PICKUP</li>
            <li class="list">PUTDOWN</li>
            <li class="list">MOVEFORWARD</li>
            <li class="list">MOVEBACK</li>
            <li class="list">MOVELEFT and MOVERIGHT until the goal is reached.</li>
           </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="just">
            Many diverse problems have been solved by artificial intelligence
            programs. Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of
            moves) in a board game, devising mathematical proofs, and
            manipulating “virtual objects” in a computer-generated world.
